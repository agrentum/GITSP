Solutions to Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation by David S. Touretzky

The solutions are not really needed, I know about it. Author provided quite
extensive solutions, my aim is to give some example code to go with the book
from the start. To be honest, I have great deal of difficulty and when I tried
Common Lisp few years back... I don't think I went past "Hello World!".

Granted, we have Rosetta Code and other services, but in somehow arrogant manner
I think this code could benefit some beginners. Even by being foul example.

I'm sorry if anyone would think I'm making too trivial comments, my main aim
is to make Lisp syntax and some easier subjects understandable for people without
any extensive background in mathematics and/or programming. Basic rule of thumb
I am using roughly states: if my 13 year old cousin seems stucked, it can be
explained better. I'm also a little fed up with how my high school and university
tried to convey programming ideas. Basically, both institutions went 'full jargon'
of relative newbies. We had higher passing rate at Real Analysis and Vector Calculus
then Introduction to Programming :/.

I have added chapter 2, very preliminary version. I have explained some points about
variables and intend to show some less bare-bones solutions, while keeping them
valid and relevant.

There is also small file fun.lisp that seems out of place. I want to provide some
toy-grade code, simplistic games mostly. First one is 'guess my number'. There is
some room for improvements and I encourage looking at it after first and begining
of second chapter. Plan for now states: the further in code, the more complex it
will get. But first 5-10 games I want to make (rock-paper-scissors, crabs,
blackjack etc) using only material from first two chapters supplemented by some
functions I coered in comments (format, random, read etc).
