Solutions to Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation by David S. Touretzky

The solutions are not really needed, I know about it. Author provided quite
extensive solutions, my aim is to give some example code to go with the book
from the start. To be honest, I have great deal of difficulty and when I tried
Common Lisp few years back... I don't think I went past "Hello World!".

Granted, we have Rosetta Code and other services, but in somehow arrogant manner
I think this code could benefit some beginners. Even by being foul example.

I'm sorry if anyone would think I'm making too trivial comments, my main aim
is to make Lisp syntax and some easier subjects understandable for people without
any extensive background in mathematics and/or programming. Basic rule of thumb
I am using roughly states: if my 13 year old cousin seems stucked, it can be
explained better. I'm also a little fed up with how my high school and university
tried to convey programming ideas. Basically, both institutions went 'full jargon'
of relative newbies. We had higher passing rate at Real Analysis and Vector Calculus
then Introduction to Programming :/.
