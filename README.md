Solutions to Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation by David S. Touretzky

The solutions are not really needed, I know about it. Author provided quite
extensive solutions, my aim is to give some example code to go with the book
from the start. To be honest, I have great deal of difficulty and when I tried
Common Lisp few years back... I don't think I went past "Hello World!".

Granted, we have Rosetta Code and other services, but in somehow arrogant manner
I think this code could benefit some beginners. Even by being foul example.
